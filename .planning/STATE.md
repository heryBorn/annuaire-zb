# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Association members can find and connect with each other by profession, location, and availability — and new members can apply to join.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Scaffold)
Plan: 1 of 6 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed 01-01: CRA bootstrap

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: CRA over Vite — user preference; stick to react-scripts 5
- [Setup]: REACT_APP_ prefix required for env vars — restart dev server after any .env change
- [Setup]: Tailwind content config must include `./src/**/*.{js,jsx}` — missing this strips styles in production
- [Setup]: FontAwesome SVG packages only — no global CSS injection; tree-shakeable
- [Phase 5]: no-cors POST — show success screen on fetch resolve, never read response.ok or response.json()
- [Phase 01-scaffold]: CRA subdirectory pattern: annuaire-zb-react/ lives inside existing static site repo — existing HTML pages untouched
- [Phase 01-scaffold]: .env excluded from .gitignore in CRA subdir — CRA only excludes .env.local by default, must explicitly add .env

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Google Apps Script response shape (`data.members`) assumed but not validated against live script — must verify in Phase 3
- Registration form field names must match exactly what the current `inscription.html` POSTs — verify before Phase 5
